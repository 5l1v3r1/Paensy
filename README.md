# Paensy 0.1 by Ozuru (http://www.malware.cat/)

## What is Paensy?

Paensy is a combination of the word payload and Teensy - Paensy is an attacker-oriented library written for the development of Teensy devices. Paensy simplifies mudane tasks and allows an easier platform for scripting.

## Getting Started With Paensy

You will need the [Teensy USB Development Board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) and [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html). The PJRC website has a [very easy to use guide](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/first_use.html) on getting Teensyduino setup.

Once Teensyduino is installed and working, place the PaensyLib folder inside Arduino\libraries\. To utilize Paensy, simply include the library in your code:

    #include <paensy.h>

## Payloads

Inside the payloads folder you will find a few simple payloads that I have created using Paensy. Feel free to modify/edit them however you wish.

If you make a payload that you'd like to share, please, open a ticket and I'll gladly add it to the payloads section!
